.. index:: Summary
.. _summary:

Summary
*********

We share the same objectives:

- Uphold the United States Constitution
- Maximize rights to Life, Liberty, and pursuit of Happiness
- Minimize violent crime, organized crime, financial crime, property
  crime
- Minimize human trafficking (labor trafficking, sex trafficking)
- Minimize unintentional and intentional self harm (suicide, drug overdose,
  self abuse)
- Minimize cost of trade dispute litigation

We seem to disagree on how best to legally ensure that persons
retain their Constitutionally-protected natural rights to
Life, Liberty, and pursuit of Happiness
while achieving these objectives.

- All laws must grant equal rights.
  If a law does not grant equal rights it is unconstitutional and
  therefore illegal.

- Our government was created to protect the natural rights of citizens.
  Natural rights of a citizen include the rights to Life, Liberty, and
  pursuit of Happiness.

The Controlled Substances Act ("CSA") is unconstitutional because it
grants different rights to citizens (on the basis of medical disability
(an "obvious or immutable" characteristic of a person)).

- If a person can cause injury to themself in order to gain a right,
  that indicates unequal rights.
- If a person loses their right by curing their disability,
  that indicates unequal rights.

The Controlled Substances Act ("CSA") is unconstitutional because
it denies citizens their natural rights to Life, Liberty, and pursuit of
Happiness.

- Alcohol Prohibition (which failed) required a Constitutional
  Amendment;
  presumably because they didn't feel that they had the right to
  infringe citizens' rights to Liberty and Happiness
  (as enumerated in the 5th Amendment and as certainly admitted by the
  9th Amendment).
- A person with a cliff in their backyard has the liberty to jump off
  it.
- A person has the right to play football, hockey, boxing,
  mixed martial arts (MMA),
  ride rodeo, jump out of an
  airplane, operate firearms recreationally, and even commit suicide.
  Said acts are covered by Liberty and pursuit of Happiness.
- If a person causes injury or loss, such as property damage,
  they may be criminally or civilly liable
  because they have then infringed another person's rights.

The government -- specifically the Judicial Branches of our Federal and
State governments -- is obligated to hear disputes between parties who
feel that their rights have been infringed.
In order to reduce the costs of said disputes,
we develop community standards ("legal guidelines", "regulations",
"laws") for
fairly, equally, and speedily resolving said disputes.

In medicine, we teach physicians to:

    Treat each patient as an individual, given what we know from data
    that individuals in the population with similar conditions
    have consented to sharing.

In law, we require Laws, Judges, and public defenders to:

    **Treat everyone equally.**

Risk-taking activities like war, contact or collision sports,
and irresponsible self-medication ("substance abuse")
do cost the taxpayers money. For situations in which one party causes
loss to another party, we have "liability".
We have releases of liability, liability insurance, reparations,
standards and duties of care. We have concepts of recklessness,
negligence, consent, representation, motivation, and intent.

    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
    **all men are created equal**,
    that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
    unalienable Rights, that among these are
    **Life**, **Liberty** and **the pursuit of Happiness**.
    -- That to secure these rights, Governments are
    instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of
    the governed,
    -- That whenever any Form of Government becomes
    destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or
    to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its
    foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such

US Constitution 9th Amendment
-------------------------------

- The 9th Amendment clarifies that the US Constitution is not meant to
  be an exhaustive list of the (natural) rights of a citizen.

  - The purpose of the US Constitution is to:

    - define roles, branches, dates and times, and obligations to hear
      disputes
    - *intentionally* limit the powers of the government

      - Alcohol prohibition required an Amendment
        (which is out of place, as it limits the rights of citizens and
        not the government).

- If we admit *any* rights under the 9th Amendment
  (a somewhat 'open clause'),
  we certainly admit as **constitutionally protected**
  those specifically listed as "unalienable" [sic]
  rights in the :ref:`US Declaration of Independence`:
  :ref:`Life`, :ref:`Liberty`, and the pursuit of :ref:`Happiness`.

Equal Protection Clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause


    All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
    the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of
    the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any
    law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of
    the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,
    liberty, or property, without due process of law; **nor deny to any
    person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.**

- Does Equal Protection apply to the Federal government?

  - Why wouldn't it? Why wouldn't our highest principle of justice (viz.
    Supreme Court building transom (:ref:`Equal justice under law`))
    also apply to Federal law?
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolling_v._Sharpe

    - It's *actually* the :ref:`US Constitution 5th Amendment`

- Whether equally or unequally,
  State laws may not abridge constitutionally protected rights,
  privileges, or immunities:

  - :ref:`9th Amendment <US Constitution 9th Amendment>` --
    constitutionally protected natural rights
  - :ref:`14th Amendment <US Constitution 14th Amendment>` --
    privileges and immunities, equal protection, equal rights
  - :ref:`Supremacy Clause` --
    The US Constitution is supreme to federal acts and state laws.

   "equal rights"
   (:ref:`Article 1 <UNDHR Article 1>`, :ref:`Article 2 <UNDHR Article 2>`)

- An example of how intent (mens rea) is relevant to a criminal case:

  - X gets into a fight with Y in a bar.

    X later learns that Y was a peace officer.

    Because X did not know that Y was a peace officer,
    X could not have had intent to assault a peace officer
    (a greater offense).

  - Model Penal Code: Purposely, Knowingly, Recklessly, Negligently
  - Common Law (Federal): Malice Aforethought, Specific Intent, General
    Intent
  - **Motive**

    Intent should not be confused with motive,
    which is the reason the defendant commits
    the criminal act or actus reus.
    Motive can generate intent, support a defense,
    and be used to determine sentencing.
    However, motive alone does not constitute

Liability
==========
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_liability

- When a legal civil dispute is raised (when a claim is made),
  determination of liability is necessary:
  who is responsible for how much loss and how much do they owe?
- In particular,
  the Government is obligated to resolve legal disputes between
  buyers and sellers of goods and services.
- As a community, we develop standards, tests,
  and guidelines for equitably resolving civil and criminal disputes.

Buyer beware
-------------
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveat_emptor#United_States

    Under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, adopted by all U.S. states,
    the sale of new goods is governed by the "perfect-tender" rule unless the
    parties to the sale expressly agree in advance to terms equivalent to caveat
    emptor (such as describing the goods as sold "as is" and/or "with all
    faults") or other limitations such as the below-discussed limitations on
    remedies. The perfect-tender rule states that if a buyer who inspects new
    goods with reasonable promptness discovers them to be "nonconforming"
    (failing to meet the description provided or any other standards reasonably
    expectable by a buyer in his/her situation) and does not use the goods or
    take other actions constituting acceptance of them, the buyer may promptly
    return or refuse to accept ("reject") them and demand that the defect be
    remedied ("cured").

- Buyer beware **is not** the law.

Numerator and Denominator
--------------------------
| Wikipedia: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerator
| Wikipedia: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denominator

- A fraction has a numerator and a denominator.
- A proportion is a fraction (generally with a fixed denominator).
- Epidemiological :ref:`Incidence rates <incidence rate>` are proportions:
  "1 in a million", "10 in 10 million".

- For many years in the United States,
  the incentive was to create strains with high density and high THC
  content.

  Some people prefer strains with low-to-no THC (and lots of CBD).
  It's easier to buy low-to-no THC strains from a dispensary with

      A hypothetical link between marijuana smoking and cancer has been
      established based on a number of misleading assumptions. However,
      recent studies tend to suggest, if anything, an inverse
      association between marijuana use and cancers. To test the
      hypothesis that marijuana smoking significantly lowers the risk of
      developing cancer in humans, we analyzed published data from a
      prospective cohort study on cancer incidence among nonsmokers
      (NS), marijuana-only smokers (MS), tobacco-only smokers (TS), and
      marijuana and tobacco smokers (MTS).  Using the log linear model
      to calculate the probability of developing each cancer form as a
      function of the interaction between marijuana and tobacco smoking,
      as well as functions of marijuana and tobacco smoking main effects
      whereby chi square statistics were calculated for the interaction
      and main effect estimates, we found that in all cases tested there
      was a significantly lower risk for MS compared to TS.

  Ranked according to lung cancer rate from low to high:

    sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic **needles**, and
    from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.
    Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV.
    Methods of prevention include *safe sex*, **needle exchange programs**,
    treating those who are infected, and male circumcision.  Disease in
    a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child
    antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however,
    antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may
    lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as
    soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average
    survival time after infection is 11 years.

.. index:: Alcohol Prohibition
.. _alcohol prohibition:

Alcohol Prohibition (1920-1933)
================================
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States

- Alcohol prohibition didn't work.
- For the first two years, alcohol consumption and crime were down.
- And then alcohol consumption, toxic overdose, organized crime,
  violent crime, tax evasion, and scofflaw-ism increased.
- Alcohol prohibition required a Constitutional Amendment
  (the 18th Amendment) and a federal act (the Volstead Act).
  Presumably, Alcohol prohibition required an amendment because
  Congress did not believe that the Constitution enumerates any such
  right to restrict the *unalienable* natural rights to
  :ref:`Liberty` and :ref:`pursuit of Happiness`.
- State Alcohol prohibition laws had religious and medical exceptions:
  they were :ref:`unequal <equality>` and thus illegal by the terms of
  the :ref:`Equal Protection Clause`.
- There are still dry counties in the United States today.

.. _Tetraethyllead:

Tetraethyllead (1921-1996)
=============================
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead

A brief history of leaded gasoline in the United States:

- 1921: DuPont discovered and GM patented "no-knock" leaded gasoline:
  they added TEL (tetraethyllead) lead to it.
- Lead had been known to be poisonous for thousands of years.
- 1925: TEL lead production was suspended because production workers
  were dying
- 1940s-50: Clair Patterson set out to calculate the age of the earth
  from rocks and arctic ice cores using the decay rate of uranium
  (uranium decays into lead at a predictable rate).

  Patterson discovered a significant increase in lead in the samples
  at layers corresponding to the introduction of TEL lead.

  He argued with the US Government for years about the health risks
  of leaded gasoline.

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clean_Room
- Many physicians began to review the health effects of lead.
- 1973: US EPA institutes "lead phase down" program
- 1993: Canada bans leaded gasoline
- 1994: study finds that blood lead levels decreased 78% from 1976-1991
- 1996: US Clean Air Act entirely bans leaded gasoline in street legal vehicles
- 2000: EU bans leaded gasoline
- 2007: NASCAR switches to unleaded fuel
- 2011: UN announces that leaded gasoline is banned worldwide

Health effects of leaded gasoline:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning
- **https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning#Signs_and_symptoms**
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead-crime_hypothesis

      The lead-crime hypothesis is the proposed link between elevated
      blood lead levels in children and later increases in crime.
      Children exposed to forms of lead at young ages are hypothesized
      to be more likely to develop learning disabilities, attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder, and problems with impulse control.
      These problems are suggested to lead to the commission of more
      crimes as these children reach adulthood, especially violent
      crimes.

      Lead is widely understood to be toxic to multiple organs of the human
      body, particularly the human brain. Concerns about even low levels of
      exposure began in the 1970s; in the decades since, **scientists have
      concluded that no safe threshold for lead exposure exists.**

      The major source of lead exposure during the 20th century was leaded
      gasoline. Proponents of the lead-crime hypothesis argue that the removal
      of lead additives from motor fuel, and the consequent decline in
      children's lead exposure, explains the fall in crime rates in the United
      States beginning in the 1990s. *This hypothesis also offers an
      explanation of the rise in crime in the preceding decades as the result
      of increased lead exposure throughout the mid-20th century.*

    FOREWORD: The motion picture you are about to witness may startle
    you. It would not have been possible, otherwise, to sufficiently
    emphasize the frightful toll of the new drug menace which is
    destroying the youth of America in alarmingly-increasing numbers.
    *Marihuana* is that drug -- a violent narcotic -- an unspeakable
    scourge -- *The Real Public Enemy Number One!* Its first effect is
    sudden, violent, uncontrollable laughter; then come dangerous
    hallucinations -- space expands -- time slows down, almost stands
    still ....fixed ideas come next, conjuring up monstrous
    extravagances -- followed by emotional disturbances, the total
    inability to direct thoughts, the loss of all power to resist
    physical emotions... leading finally to acts of shocking violence...
    ending often in incurable insanity. In picturing its soul-destroying
    effects no attempt was made to equivocate. The scenes and incidents,
    while fictionized [sic] for the purposes of this story, are based upon
    actual research into the results of Marihuana addiction. If their
    stark reality will make you *think*, will make you aware that
    something *must be done* to wipe out this ghastly menace, then the
    picture will not have failed in its purpose.... Because the dread
    *Marihuana* may be reaching forth next for your son or daughter....or
    *yours*....or *YOURS*!

Line of questioning
---------------------
Have you sworn an :ref:`Oath <oath of office>`
to uphold the laws of the :ref:`US Constitution`?

...

Is the federal government obligated by 
:ref:`Equal Protection Clause` of
the :ref:`US Constitution` to
grant equal rights to all citizens?

Does the front of the US Supreme Court Building
read ":ref:`Equal Justice Under Law`"?

Does the :ref:`US Declaration of Independence`
read "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
**all men are created equal**,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights, that among these are
**Life**, **Liberty** and **the pursuit of Happiness**."?


Does the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)
grant different rights to different citizens on the basis of disability?

Is the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) therefore unconstitutional
(because it does not grant equal rights to all citizens)?

...

Does The Constitution, by the :ref:`9th amendment`,
admit "Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness"
as Constitutionally protected rights of all citizens?

...

Why did :ref:`alcohol prohibition` require a Constitutional amendment;
why wouldn't a federal act have been sufficient?

What were the direct costs of alcohol prohibition?

What were the external costs of alcohol prohibition?

Did alcohol prohibition violate citizens' unalienable rights to
Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness?

...

How did forcing drug markets underground help foreign powers?

Do we intend to continue effectively subsidizing a cash drugs economy
by keeping drugs illegal?

Would we prefer for patients to speak with their physician(s)
about how they are self-medicating
and what seems to work for them individually?

Do we want people to
feel comfortable asking for help in their pursuits of happiness?

Is there, in the status quo,
a disincentive for patients who are self-medicating
with scheduled substances to speak openly with their physician?

| Are you a physician?
| Are you an attorney?
| Are you a logician?
| Is logic a part of your daily work?

How difficult is it to prove a universal quantification
(that something is true or not true for all patients)?

Does an existential quantification
(one or more counterexamples)
invalidate a universal quantification?

In order to compare relative hazard ratios,
do we require both a numerator and a denominator?

[...]

Which other policy approaches in which other countries
are resulting in lower overdose rates and lower costs to the taxpayers?

Should our policies require that we reevaluate our approach
according to predefined and more recently evaluated metrics
after a predetermined amount of time?

| Are you familiar with the Scientific Method?
| Six Sigma DMAIC?
| Control systems theory?

What should we do when what we're doing is not working;
when what we're doing is not achieving the objectives we've set for ourselves?

...

Please forgive use of the word "you' here:

Have I paid you to make medical decisions on my behalf?

Do I pay you to peacefully resolve trade disputes?

Do I pay you to resolve issues of liability
between buyers and sellers of medical goods, services, and advice?

Do I pay you to prevent me from inadvertently or inefficiently
causing my own death?

Do I pay you to ensure that all citizens have Equal rights to
Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness?
