US Declaration of Independence
===============================
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence
| Homepage: http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html

    [...]

    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
    **all men are created equal**,
    that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
    unalienable Rights, that among these are
    **Life**, **Liberty** and **the pursuit of Happiness**.
    --That to secure these rights, Governments are
    instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of
    the governed,
    --That whenever any Form of Government becomes
    destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or
    to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its
    foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such
    form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their *Safety* and
    *Happiness*.

.. _us constitution 9th amendment:

US Constitution 9th Amendment
-------------------------------
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution

- The 9th Amendment clarifies that the US Constitution is not meant to
  be an exhaustive list of the (natural) rights of a citizen.

  - The purpose of the US Constitution is to:

    - define roles, branches, dates and times, and obligations to hear
      disputes
    - *intentionally* limit the powers of the government

      - Alcohol prohibition required an Amendment
        (which is out of place, as it limits the rights of citizens and
        not the government).
  
- If we admit *any* rights under the 9th Amendment
  (a somewhat 'open clause'),
  we certainly admit as **constitutionally protected**
  those specifically listed as "unalienable" [sic]
  rights in the :ref:`US Declaration of Independence`:
  :ref:`Life`, :ref:`Liberty`, and the pursuit of :ref:`Happiness`.

Privileges or Immunities Clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Privileges_or_Immunities_Clause

- Not to be confused with the Privileges of Immunities Clause
  in the Constitution proper.

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privileges_or_Immunities_Clause
- ~States must honor Federally recognized privileges and immunities.

  - Does this include Federally-recognized rights such as those admitted
    by the :ref:`9th Amendment <US Constitution 9th Amendment>`?
  - Is this somewhat redundant to the :ref:`Supremacy Clause`
    in that it clarifies that state laws do not supersede
    Constitutional and federal law? (What immunities?)


.. index:: Equal Protection Clause
.. _equal protection clause:

Equal Protection Clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause


    All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
    the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of
    the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any
    law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of
    the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,
    liberty, or property, without due process of law; **nor deny to any
    person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.**

- Does Equal Protection apply to the Federal government?

  - Why wouldn't it? Why wouldn't our highest principle of justice (viz.
    Supreme Court building transom (:ref:`Equal justice under law`))
    also apply to Federal law?
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolling_v._Sharpe

    - It's *actually* the :ref:`US Constitution 5th Amendment`

- Whether equally or unequally,
  State laws may not abridge constitutionally protected rights,
  privileges, or immunities:
  
  - :ref:`9th Amendment <US Constitution 9th Amendment>` --
    constitutionally protected natural rights
  - :ref:`14th Amendment <US Constitution 14th Amendment>` --
    privileges and immunities, equal protection, equal rights
  - :ref:`Supremacy Clause` --
    The US Constitution is supreme to federal acts and state laws.

.. note:: The :ref:`UN Declaration of Human Rights` mentions both
   "equal rights"
   (:ref:`Article 1 <UNDHR Article 1>`, :ref:`Article 2 <UNDHR Article 2>`)
   and
   "equal protections" (:ref:`Article 7 <UNDHR Article 7>`).

   AFAIU, US Law makes no distinction between rights and protections:
   "equal rights" and "equal protections" are synonomous in US Law.

- Mens rea is necessary element in a criminal case.

  - The :ref:`5th Amendment` clarifies the right to not self-incriminate.

- Mens rea is not necessarily necessary for a civil case.
- An example of how intent (mens rea) is relevant to a criminal case:

  - X gets into a fight with Y in a bar.

    X later learns that Y was a peace officer.

    Because X did not know that Y was a peace officer,
    X could not have had intent to assault a peace officer
    (a greater offense).

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea#United_States

  - MPC: Purposely, Knowingly, Recklessly, Negligently
    Strict Liability, Negligently, Recklessly, Knowingly, Purposefully
  - Common Law (Federal): Malice Aforethought, Specific Intent, General
    Intent
  - **Motive**

    Intent should not be confused with motive,
    which is the reason the defendant commits
    the criminal act or actus reus.
    Motive can generate intent, support a defense,
    and be used to determine sentencing.
    However, motive alone does not constitute
    mens rea and does not act as a substitute for criminal intent.

- CBD is not psychoactive.
- CBD is not scheduled.
- CBD is sort of like an 'antidote' to THC.

  - CBD may be a good treatment for THC overdose.

- For many years in the United States,
  the incentive was to create strains with high density and high THC
  content.

  Some people prefer strains with low-to-no THC (and lots of CBD).
  It's easier to buy low-to-no THC strains from a dispensary with
  consistent inventory.
- CBD is not yet available as an approved *on-label*
  treatment in the United States.

  - Epidiolex is a CBD treatment for Epilepsy which is currently
    in the clinical trial phase for FDA clearance.

    - "Nocebo effect"
  
      - CBD is not psychoactive. In one trial,
        69% of patients receiving the control experienced
        adverse events which they attributed to the treatment;
        as compared with 86% of patients who received CBD.

        (86 - 69 = 17%)

    - According to this chart [TODO mydx],
      patients who self-report as having epilepsy 
      (who are conscientious enough to purchase a portable chemical
      analyzing device to test their cannabis
      and willing to share their medical information)
      do prefer strains with *some* THC (and other terpenes and
      cannabinoids).

.. _cbn:

CBN
^^^^^^
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinol

- CBN (Cannabinol) is a cannabinoid.
- CBN is mildly sedative.

  Myrcene, a terpene, is also mildly sedative.
- CBN forms as a byproduct of the breakdown of :ref:`THC`
  into THC-V and CBN.

  Over time, with heat and light (TODO),
  THC breaks down into THC-V and CBN.
- Fresh cannabis contains very little CBN.

CBC
^^^^^
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabichromene

- CBC (Cannabichromene) is a cannabinoid.
- CBC is non-psychotropic.
- CBC is not scheduled.
- CBC may contribute to the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral,
  and anti-fungal effects of cannabis.
- CBC has a boiling point of 428 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees
  Celsius);
  which is significantly higher than the boiling points of
  :ref:`CBD`, :ref:`CBN`, and :ref:`THC`.


.. index:: Boiling Points
.. _boiling points:

Boiling Points
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Each cannabinoid (and terpene) has a unique boiling point.
- A vaporizer boils (sublimates) the oils out of cannabis flowers
  and/or concentrates. (see: :ref:`Routes of Administration`).
- Pesticides and herbicides also have boiling points:

  For example, glyphosate has a boiling point of 369 degrees Fahrenheit.
- A butane lighter has a maximum temperature of 1900 degrees Celsius
  (3452 degree Fahrenheit); and an actual temperate somewhere around 
  900 degrees Celsius (1652 degrees Fahrenheit).

  - 1652 degrees Fahrenheit is so hot that the carbon in cannabis
    combusts;
    producing Carbon Monoxide (CO).

    - Carbon Monoxide is known to cause DNA methylation.

  - Holding the flame so that it does not contact the flowers
    reduces the temperature of the flame reaching the flowers.

Deployment Challenges:

Legal cannabis alternatives in WWII:

- Alcohol (linked to violence)
- Amphetamine (linked to violence)

- :ref:`Acetaminophen` (toxic at > 4000mg/day for an adult)
- Diphenhydramine (sedative ("PM"), anti-itch)
- Tobacco (MAOI anti-depressant, cancer-causing)
- Arsenic-based pesticides
